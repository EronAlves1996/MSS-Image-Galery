# User Stories

The User Stories is a Scrum technique to help on gathering the requirements and subdivide the application development into tiny achievable parts. These parts can be prioritized, taking into account some criteria, helping on the management of application.

1. PU1 - As a possible user, I wanna to see some description of the application in the initial page, to help me decide if I wanna to use it or not
2. PU2 - As a possible user, I wanna to see some clearful and easy way to registrate myself to be a user of the application
3. U1 - As an user, I want to login into the application, to use them into it's integrality and start/continue to store photos
4. U2 - As an user, I trust the application that my photos will not be shared and will be ever secure, to preserve my privacity
5. U3 - As an user, may I want to edit my own data, having it updated or for some other reason
6. U4 - As an user, I want to delete my own account for any reason, and have my photos deleted too
7. U5 - As an user, I want to see easy ways to upload my photos and create new albums, not needing to think too much or try to dig into the application to find functionalities
8. U6 - As an user, I want to upload a photo in no album, having it acessible right away, not constrained on album organization
9. U7 - As an user, I want to create an album, to organize some photos on it
